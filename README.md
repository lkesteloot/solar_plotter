# Solar plotter

Code to support a solar plotter, which is a device that burns 2-D patterns into
wood by focusing the sunâ€™s light using a moving magnifying glass.

The `adjust_for_sun.py` script adjusts a G-code file to take into account
the movement of the earth while the plot is on-going. It pre-moves the
plot so that the position will be correct after the earth rotates.

    % python adjust_for_sun.py < in.g > out.g

If you don't do that, circles don't even close, like the `e` in the lower-right
of this plot:

The `GCodes.java` program converts a raster image to a G-code file to burn
that image using a solar plotter.

    % javac GCodes.java
    % java GCodes bertrand-russell-high-res.jpg

It works better on low-res images:
